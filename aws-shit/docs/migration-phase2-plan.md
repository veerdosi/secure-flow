# SecureFlow Migration - Phase 2 Action Plan

## Immediate Testing Tasks (Next 2-4 Hours)

### 1. API Endpoint Discovery & Testing
Your main API is deployed but we need to identify which endpoints are active.

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Run comprehensive endpoint testing to discover active routes
- [ ] Test authentication endpoints (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/register)
- [ ] Validate protected routes with JWT tokens
- [ ] Test database operations (user management, project operations)

### 2. Frontend Integration Preparation  
**Current Frontend API Base:** `https://secure-flow-ymkc.onrender.com` (Render)
**New AWS API Base:** `https://im3t8e4bwg.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/`

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Identify all API calls in frontend code
- [ ] Create environment variable for API base URL
- [ ] Test API calls with new AWS endpoint
- [ ] Verify CORS functionality

### 3. Performance & Reliability Testing
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Response time baseline (target: <500ms 95th percentile)
- [ ] Concurrent request testing
- [ ] Database connection pooling validation
- [ ] Error handling verification

## Next Phase Preview: Cutover (Phase 3)

Once Phase 2 testing is complete, you'll:
1. Update Vercel environment variables to point to AWS API
2. Update GitLab webhook configurations  
3. Monitor the production cutover
4. Validate end-to-end functionality

## Success Criteria for Phase 2
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow works with AWS Lambda
- [ ] Database operations function properly
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (<500ms response time)
- [ ] Error rates remain below 1%

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 2 Testing**: 1-2 days
- **Phase 3 Cutover**: 4-6 hours
- **Phase 4 Cleanup**: 1 day

## Risk Mitigation
- Render API remains active as fallback
- All AWS resources can be quickly rolled back
- Database remains on MongoDB Atlas (no migration risk)
