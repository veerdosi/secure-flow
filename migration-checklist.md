### Phase 3: Cutover & Integration
- [ ] Update Vercel frontend environment variables to use AWS API
- [ ] Update GitLab webhook URLs to use AWS webhook handler
- [ ] Monitor AWS Lambda metrics and CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Validate end-to-end functionality after cutover
- [ ] Update any hardcoded API URLs in client application
- [ ] Test all user workflows with new infrastructure
- [ ] Monitor error rates and performance metrics

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Verify Lambda stability (24h minimum)
- [ ] Delete Render service
- [ ] Delete Google Cloud Functions
- [ ] Cancel unused subscriptions

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Triggers
If any of these occur, execute immediate rollback:
- [ ] API error rate > 5%
- [ ] Database connection failures
- [ ] Authentication failures
- [ ] Webhook processing failures
- [ ] Frontend unable to connect to API

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
- [ ] API response time < 500ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] All user workflows functional
- [ ] Cost reduction achieved
- [ ] Zero data loss confirmed
